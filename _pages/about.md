​I am an assistant professor in Statistics at the [Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (ISBA)](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/isba), part of the [Louvain Institute of Data Analysis and Modeling in economics and statistics (LIDAM)](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam) of the [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en). 

My main research field is extreme value theory, with a focus on environmental applications, the development of statistical methodology for multivariate extremes, ​high-dimensional modelling, and spatial extremes. Recently, I've been particularly interested in topics related to the climate sciences, such as climate extreme event attribution and compound extremes.

Don't hesitate to contact me if you're looking for a PhD or post-doc position!
