​I am an assistant professor in Statistics at the EMCP Faculty and the Department of Mathematics of the [University
of Namur](https://unamur.be) since September 2018. Before that, I was affiliated with the Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR) as a fixed-term assistant professor and at the Université catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain) as a PhD student and postdoctoral researcher. 

My main research field is extreme value theory, with a focus on environmental applications, the development of statistical methodology for multivariate extremes,
​high-dimensional modelling, and spatial extremes. Recently, I've been particularly interested in topics related to the climate sciences, such as climate extreme event attribution and compound extremes.

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
