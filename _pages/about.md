​I am an assistant professor in Statistics at the [Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (ISBA)](https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam/isba), part of the [Louvain Institute of Data Analysis and Modeling in economics and statistics (LIDAM)] (https://www.uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/lidam) of the [UCLouvain](https://www.uclouvain.be/en). My main research field is extreme value theory, with a focus on environmental applications, the development of statistical methodology for multivariate extremes, ​high-dimensional modelling, and spatial extremes. Recently, I've been particularly interested in topics related to the climate sciences, such as climate extreme event attribution and compound extremes.
