## ARC (Action de recherche concertée), 2024-2029, UCLouvain

### EXtreme weather Attribution at mid- and high-Latitudes using advanced statistical Techniques*(EXALT) 

An interdisciplinary effort involving the Earth and Climate Center (part of ELI, the Earth and Life Institute) and the institute of Statistics, Biostatistics and Actuarial Sciences (part of LIDAM, the Louvain Institute of Data Analysis and Modeling in economics and statistics). Supported by the programme *Action de Recherche Concertée (ARC)* of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation, co-supervised by Francesco Ragone (University of Leicester), François Massonnet (UCLouvain),  Hugues Goosse (UCLouvain) and Johan Segers (KULeuven and UCLouvain).

The overall objective of EXALT is to introduce a novel comprehensive framework for extreme event attribution and to apply it to the most influential events in the mid-high latitudes, namely heatwaves and compound drought-heat events over Europe, floods in southern and northern Europe, and sea ice extent over the Antarctic. For more information, see our [website](https://exalt-project.github.io/).

## MIS (*Mandat d'impulsion scientifique*), funded by the [F.R.S-FNRS](https://www.frs-fnrs.be/en/), 2024-2028

### Flexible statistical models for compound climate events 

Funding instrument to support young permanent researchers who seek to develop a scientific unit focusing on a future-oriented area within their university.

The objectives of this project are to (i) propose flexible multivariate dependence models that are capable of arealistic representation of both center and tail(s) of a random vector, to (ii) propose estimators of theparameters of such models with the goal of inferring failure probabilities for multivariate extreme events andimprove their precision via data augmentation and (iii) project climate-induced risks of some major compoundevents in terms of global warming.
